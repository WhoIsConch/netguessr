# Welcome to NetGuessr!

NetGuessr is a simple web game that gives you one goal: Guess the net worth of the given famous person/celebrity.

NetGuessr is built using Python with Flask and JavaScript with jQuery. 

Sources for celebrity net worth information are provided by different sources, including Forbes (~100) and The Richest (~1,100). 

## To run:
